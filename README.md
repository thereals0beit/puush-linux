puush-linux
===========

Modified by s0beit [puromonogatari on github]!

A Bash script for uploading files to puush.me from Linux. Opens a new chromium tab when upload is complete automatically!


Using
-----

* Put puu.sh in your /usr/local/sbin/ folder, or your /usr/bin/ folder, or whatever you like, I suppose.
* This version requires chromium browser for now, but you can modify it to open firefox tabs if you like (might be fixed later to detect browsers)
* edit the file and replace the email, api key and endpoint with your own (you can use puush, or your own server!)
* execute `puu.sh "filename here"`
